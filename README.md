Class Size Visualizer

Displays the sizes of the things a Java class is made of. This project should help you answer the question <<Why is my class so big?>>. Class size is normally not something you optimize for but when you generate hundreds of classes you may want to look at it.

Similar to []() but instead of displaying the method size in bytecodes it displays the size of the method in the class file including metadata.
